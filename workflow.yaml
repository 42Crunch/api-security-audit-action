# The REST API Static Security Testing action locates REST API contracts that follow the 
# OpenAPI Specification (OAS, formerly known as Swagger) and runs thorough security checks 
# on them. Both OAS v2 and v3.0.x are supported, in both JSON and YAML format.
#
# Documentation is located here: https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_github_actions.htm
#
# To use this workflow, you will need a customer/evaluation tenant on a 42Crunch SaaS platform.
#
# 1. Follow steps at https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_github_actions.htm
#    to create an API Token on the 42Crunch platform
#
# 2. Add a secret in GitHub as explained in https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_github_actions.htm,
#    store the 42Crunch API Token in that secret, and supply the secret's name as api-token parameter in this workflow
